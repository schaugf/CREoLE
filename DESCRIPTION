Description: The creole package is a series of tools designed to estimate gene
    expression trends through pseudo- or development-time given single-cell RNA-
    seq data. The code is designed in three parts. creole_map models the data in a
    low-dimensional space and calculates lineage divergence and a putative origin.
    Creole_lines estimates a fine-resolution pseudo-temporal signal for each input
    gene through each lineage. Creole_plot shows this data visually and creates
    figures to facilitate an interpretation of the data presented.
