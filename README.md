# creole

CREoLE is a general purpose statistical signal processing algorithm for single-cell genomics. Using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, CREoLE computes estimated developmental expression of genes in pseudo-time through heterogeneous biological tissue. CREoLE is specifically designed to automate lineage structure establishment while addressing technical limitations presented by scRNA-seq such as increased variability and drop-out measurements. CREoLE is designed in R.
