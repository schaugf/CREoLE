The Consensus Representation Estimation of Lineage Expression (CREoLE) algorithm is designed to recapitulate gene expression trends through developmental progression, address inherent technical challenges presented by single-cell RNA-seq, and automate key computational steps that often require user input in alternative methods. Please see CREoLE_Example.rmd for a brief tutorial on usage of the CREoLE algorithm.

Cheers!
